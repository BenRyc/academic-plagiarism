                A picraft "connection.Connection" object for an active

                _socket, encoding.
        requests
                An iterable of coordinate tuples.  See the examples.
                Note that if thread_count > 0, this will be accessed
                from another thread, and if thread_count > 1, it
                will be accessed from multiple threads.

                Function to parse the results from the server, one of:

                    lambda ans: tuple(map(int, ans.split(",")))
                Note that responses have the form "0" or "0,0".
        thread_count
                Number of threads to create.  If thread_count == 0, no
                threads are created and work is done in the current thread.
                If thread_count > 0 and the "requests" parameter is a
                generator function, consider thread safety issues.
                The maximum recommended thread_count == 30 for very large
                query sizes.
        Generated values:
        tuple(request, answer), where
